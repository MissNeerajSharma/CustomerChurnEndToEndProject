## Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project involves the analysis of the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset provides information about a telecommunication company's customers and their churn behavior. The goal of the analysis is to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers.

## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunications companies. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn and predicting which customers are at risk can help companies implement strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates. This project aims to analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and build models to predict churn.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

Link to data: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Dataset Overview
Each row represents a customer; each column contains customer attributes described in the column metadata.
The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).
After cleaning the data for later analysis, the final dataset contains 7043 rows (customers) and 41 columns (features).
Data Description
The data includes the following types of information:
Churn Reports: Information about customers who left within the last month.
Customer Services: Details on services subscribed to by the customers, such as Phone Service, Multiple Lines, Internet Service, etc.
Customer Account Information: Information about tenure, contract, payment method, charges, etc.
Customer Demographic Information: Details such as gender, partner status, dependents, etc.
Source
The dataset is sourced from the Telco Customer Churn programs on Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is performed to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Key steps in the data cleaning process include:

Handling missing values
Converting categorical variables to numerical format
Creating new features based on existing data
Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. Key EDA tasks include:

Visualizing the distribution of customer churn
Analyzing the correlation between different features and churn
Identifying significant features that contribute to churn
## Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling involves building machine learning models to predict customer churn. The following steps are involved:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Building models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Results
The results of the predictive models are analyzed to identify the most important features contributing to customer churn. Model performance metrics are presented, and the best-performing model is selected based on these metrics.

I used ### Smooth Function To address class imbalance in classification problems, you can use techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Hereâ€™s how you can apply SMOTE using Python's imbalanced-learn library:

Step-by-Step Guide
Install the Required Libraries:

If you haven't already installed the imbalanced-learn library, you can do so using pip:

pip install imbalanced-learn

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors that influence customer churn and demonstrates the effectiveness of predictive modeling in identifying at-risk customers. The findings can help telecommunications companies develop targeted strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.
